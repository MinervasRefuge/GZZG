A typed Zig wrapper for the Guile (scheme) C API.

Includes an experimental (read: unstable likely to change) direct memory access API.

Requires ~libguile-3.0~. Currently targeting ~zig@0.14~

Note that this is very much ðŸš§ /work in progress/ ðŸš§.

** Note regarding ~setjmp~ / ~longjmp~
Zig considers unsound and can't be used. [[https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1656][Issue 1656]]. So those corners /currently/ are a little rough.
