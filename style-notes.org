* Style Notes[fn:1]
- All containers must have a field ~s~ of type ~guile.SCM~.
- If it's a composed type, it must have a declaration of ~const Child = T;~.

** Type Constraints
- ~lowerZ~ to widen the type to ~Any~
- ~raiseZ~ to narrow a type (only on ~Any~).

For composite types, ~drop~ and ~lift~ might be used to change Zig data to Guile data.
With the Number Tower, Smob types, External Types (vtables). Anything with an intermediate type (before ~Any~) does the above rules work? should there be ~sublower~ or passing the lowering type (comptime) in?
   
** Function Declaration Order
 - Use ~from*~ as a direct constructor for the Guile type.
 - Append ~Z~ if function returns Zig values, with no similar function. (companion function).
 - Append ~X~ for mutation functions (more-so based on scm function naming).
 - Append ~E~ if a known exception can be raised but isn't capture by the function. (which is many of the functions, so it may be easy to miss/not write).

Order the letters alphabetically.

If a companion ~.C~ method exists should it always be added? Should there always be ~isZ~ if there isn't a direct call? eg. not using ~Boolean.toZ()~ ~is(a).toZ()~.
